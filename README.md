# HR Data Analytics Project  
#### Overview  
This project aims to analyze HR data and identify key factors that influence employee turnover and satisfaction. The data includes information about employees' demographics, job roles, education, working conditions, and other relevant factors.  

##### The project includes a Power BI dashboard with four pages:

**Demographics:** shows the distribution of employees by gender, age, marital status, education level, etc.  
**Attrition:** analyzes the factors that contribute to employee turnover, such as salary, working requirement, distance from home etc.  
**Employee Satisfaction:** examines the factors that affect employee satisfaction, such as job involvement, environment, relationship, etc.  

#### Data Source
